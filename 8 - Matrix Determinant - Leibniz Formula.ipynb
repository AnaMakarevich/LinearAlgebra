    "Honestly, the formula looked super hairy to me at first sight. As well as at the second. So here are some concpets one need to know to read the formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Permutation**. Good old permutation that you learn at the university. For the ordered set of length $n$ we have $n!$ permutations. Not a rocket science. However, it's important to note here, that we permute the list of incides from 1 to N. So, it's a permutation on $\\{1,2,...,N\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The sign of the permutation**. Now, this is a bit more interesting. First, there is formal definition at ProofWiki - <a href=\"https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Sign_of_Permutation\">here</a>. However, it's a bit hard to apply it to our problem. Alternatively, the sign of the permutation can be determined from the number of transpositions or number of inversions (number of elements that are not in order). Even number produces 1, odd number produces -1. In other words: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{sign}(\\lambda) = (-1)^m = (-1)^{N(\\lambda)}$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where m is the number of transpositions required for the permutation, $N(\\lambda)$ is the number of elements not in order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",

    "* 1 <-> 3 -> (4,2,1,3)\n",
    "* 2 <-> 4 -> (2,4,1,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, there are 3 transpositions, and the sign of this permutation is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Method 2: Number of inversions:*  \n",
    "\n",
    "I think this method is much easier computationally and it's often suggested as homework in programming classes. We need to calculate how many elements are not in order.  \n",
